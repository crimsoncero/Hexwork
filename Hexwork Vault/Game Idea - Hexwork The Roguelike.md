Roguelike with similar playstyle to a game like Hades, (3d isometric view roguelike), where you play as a mage with a "deck" of spells.

Actions: 
Basic Attack - Each mage class has a basic attack, that doesn't cost mana, repeatable and your filler for when you can't use spells or don't want to waste them.

Spell Cast - Cast the next spell from your list of spells. Each spell does something different, whether its a different attack pattern, damage type, effect and so on. Each spell also cost a different amount of mana, making it harder and more costly to cast high mana spells but their power is also greater.

Dodge - Some kind of way to dodge incoming attacks, might be different between classes.


Classes: 
Either different characters, or some kind of a "class system" where the player can switch classes before every run. Each class has a different basic attack and starting spells (fitting to their theme and gameplay idea).  for example : Spellsword will have a more melee attack and will have more close range spells, while a Summoner will have spells that can summon entities or objects for their help.


Spell Deck - Throughout a run, the player obtains more and more spells to add to their deck, while also having ways to upgrade existing spells or removing some from the deck. 


Optional thoughts:

Discard Spell - You can discard the current next spell in the list, at some cost though, this means that you can technically skip spells that are not perfect for the scenario or in cases where the spell after is more fitting for what you need right now. The cost of discarding should be something immediate that will pose a risk/reward scenario (maybe it costs mana to discard, or something).

Two current spell slots - You have two slots to hold spells in, each with a different button to activate, this allows you to "hold" a spell for later without having to discard, while also allowing you more flexibility.

Spell Fusion - A system of "fusing" two spells (the ones currently slotted) to cast a unique spell that is only doable that way. There is no need for every two spells to be viable for fusion, and neither does every combination should yield a unique fused spell. The system should feel intuitive to learn. 



Similar Games:
One Step From Eden - a roguelike game that uses  a spell system similar to the one envisioned, but in an action grid combat like Megaman battle network. The main take from this game is the card system in a roguelike setting.

Hades - very similar perspective and gameplay, a lot of the roguelike elements in the game can be translated to this one.
